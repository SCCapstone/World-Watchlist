# World-Watchlist

Our goal is to create a news-watchlist app that will allow users to denote keywords or topics and to receive live notifications when an article is published matching their keyword or topic. Check out our [wiki](https://github.com/SCCapstone/World-Watchlist/wiki/Project-Description) for a more in depth description. 

## External Requirements

In order to build this project you first have to install:
 ``` bash
Node.js
Ionic
 ```
 

If possible, list the actual commands you used to install these, so the reader
can just cut-n-paste the commands and get everything setup.

You only need to add instructions for the OS you are using.

## Setup

Here you list all the one-time things the developer needs to do after cloning
your repo. Sometimes there is no need for this section, but some apps require
some first-time configuration from the developer, for example: setting up a
database for running your webapp locally.
 ``` bash
 git clone https://github.com/SCCapstone/World-Watchlist.git
 cd World-Watchlist/project-folder
 npm i 
 ```

## Running

Specify the commands for a developer to run the app from the cloned repo.
 ``` bash
 to run the app locally: ionic serve
 ```
# Deployment

Webapps need a deployment section that explains how to get it deployed on the 
Internet. These should be detailed enough so anyone can re-deploy if needed
. Note that you **do not put passwords in git**. 

Mobile apps will also sometimes need some instructions on how to build a
"release" version, maybe how to sign it, and how to run that binary in an
emulator or in a physical phone.

 ``` bash
unknown
 ```


# Testing

In 492 you will write automated tests. When you do you will need to add a 
section that explains how to run them.

The unit tests are in `/test/unit`.

The behavioral tests are in `/test/casper/`.

## Testing Technology

In some cases you need to install test runners, etc. Explain how.

## Running Tests

Explain how to run the automated tests.
